# StepUp App

This is an health engagement app rewarding users for engaging in physical activity, mainly walking, jogging or running.

## React Native
Steps on how to start the React Native project: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started

Assuming you have Node 10 or higher, you can use npm install the Expo CLI command line utility: 

```
npm install -g expo cli
```

Then enter the folder "StepUp-ReactNative", and start:

```
cd StepUp-ReactNative
npm start #you can also use: expo start
```

This will start the development server for you. 


### Running the React Native application

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
